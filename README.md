# Compromise Vault:  
## A web application designed to securely aggregate and manage known compromised SSH keys, providing system administrators with a centralized repository to enhance security measures and prevent unauthorized access.

## Warning: This version is a protoype and only used for testing features. Unfortunately the production version is unavailible to the general public, however you can head [here](ssh-aggregator.vercel.app) to try it out yourself.

## Description

Compromise Vault is a web application designed to manage the submission and tracking of SSH keys. It allows users to submit SSH private and public keys, ensures their validity, and stores them securely in a database. This project is useful for administrators and developers who are looking to generate key revocation lists in order to blacklist these compromised keys. 

## Limitations as of July 2024

- **Limited Database Size**
- **Only checks for RSA fingerprints. Does not check other types**
- **Does not generate a .krl file, only gives JSON data of the public keys**

All of these issues are being worked on currently.

## Redeployment
 
### Clone the repository 

```bash
https://github.com/K1zum1/Compromise-Vault
cd Compromise-Vault
```
## Install Project Dependancies
```bash
npm install
```

## Create a .env file in the project root
```bash
touch .env
```

## Add PostgreSQL Connection Details
```
POSTGRES_URL=postgres://ssh_user:your_password@localhost:5432/SSH-Key-Aggregator
```

| referer              | text                        | -          | null              | YES      |
| fingerprintValidated | character varying           | 3          | null              | YES      |


## Description of Columns:

- **privKey**: The SSH private key provided by the user.
- **pubKey**: The SSH public key provided by the user.
- **keyType**: The type of SSH key (e.g., RSA, DSA, ECDSA).
- **ipAddress**: The IP address of the user submitting the SSH keys.
- **userAgent**: The user agent string from the user's browser or application.
- **submissionDate**: The date and time when the SSH keys were submitted. Default is the current timestamp.
- **referer**: The referer URL from where the submission was made.
- **fingerprintValidated**: Indicates whether the fingerprint of the SSH key was validated.


### Table Creation Script:

```sql
CREATE TABLE SSHKeys (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    privKey TEXT,
    pubKey TEXT,
    keyType VARCHAR(255),
    ipAddress VARCHAR(255),
    userAgent TEXT,
    submissionDate TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    referer TEXT,
    fingerprintValidated VARCHAR(3)
);
```

## Build and Deploy

npm run build
npm start
```

```bash
vercel dev
```
## Usage
